# Tech Context

## Technologies Used
- Markdown for documentation
- Standard file system for storage

## Development Setup
- All documentation is kept in the `memory-bank/` directory at the project root.
- Developers must read all core files before starting work.

## Technical Constraints
- Documentation must be human-readable and easy to update.
- No proprietary formats or tools required to access context.

## Dependencies
- None beyond standard file system and Markdown readers/editors.

## Tool Usage Patterns
- Always update documentation after significant changes.
- Use clear, consistent formatting and structure.
