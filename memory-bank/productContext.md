# Product Context

## Purpose
This project exists to ensure that all critical project context is preserved and accessible, even after memory resets or onboarding new developers.

## Problems Solved
- Loss of project context due to memory resets or team changes.
- Difficulty onboarding new contributors without up-to-date documentation.
- Risk of misalignment or rework due to unclear requirements or decisions.

## How It Should Work
- All important context is documented in Markdown files within the `memory-bank/` directory.
- Developers read these files at the start of every session to regain full project context.
- Documentation is updated after significant changes or when new insights are gained.

## User Experience Goals
- Fast, frictionless onboarding for new and returning developers.
- Clear, concise, and complete documentation of project state and decisions.
- Confidence that no critical context is ever lost.
