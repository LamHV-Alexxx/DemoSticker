## Goals
- Maintain perfect, up-to-date documentation of project state, decisions, and architecture.
- Support efficient workflows for planning, acting, and updating documentation.
- Facilitate rapid understanding and continuation of work after context loss.

## Scope
- All documentation and context management is handled within the `memory-bank/` directory.
